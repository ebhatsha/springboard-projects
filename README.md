London Case Study Project:
  Context:
 There are 32 London boroughs within Greater
 London and each borough has its governing council. Some of
 them are more desirable to live in and will reflect that desirability in a greater rise in
 housing prices. I accessed datasets characterizing the boroughs from:
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-january-2017?utm_medium=GOV.UK&utm_source=summary&utm_campaign=section9&utm_term=9.30_21_03_17&utm_content=download_data

  I tried to answer, which borough of London has seen the greatest average increase in housing prices over
 the (approximately) two decades covered by the dataset? I found that to be Kensington & Chelsea.
