London Case Study Project:
  Context:
 There are 32 London boroughs within Greater
 London and each borough has its governing council. As you can guess, some of
 them are more desirable to live in and will reflect that desirability in a greater rise in
 housing prices. I accessed datasets characterizing the boroughs from:
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-january-2017?utm_medium=GOV.UK&utm_source=summary&utm_campaign=section9&utm_term=9.30_21_03_17&utm_content=download_data

  I tried to answer, which borough of London has seen the greatest average increase in housing prices over
 the (approximately) two decades covered by the dataset? I found that to be Kensington & Chelsea.
